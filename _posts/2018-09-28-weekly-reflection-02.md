What we did first this week was that we first slplit off into groups and examined the parts of a certain video game which in my case was run 3 and we talked about all the variables in the game itself. we then learned about animating shapes and moving imagery in games using pyrite I am exicted to learn more about animation so I can make my own game in pyrite
