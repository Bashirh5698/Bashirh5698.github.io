This week we started to learn about data science. We started by learning about lists and how to make them in pyret It was hard for me at first to add catagoties to the first list that we made becausei didn't know how to add catagories to the list but I looked at my notes and figured out how to add catagories to the lists i think im getting better at using pyret
