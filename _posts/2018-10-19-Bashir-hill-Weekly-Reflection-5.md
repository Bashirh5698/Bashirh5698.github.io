We started off this week in computer science by learning about overlaying images in pyret and we made simple shapes, it was hard at first for me to understand the ovelay command but I pulled through and figured it out. On Wednesday we finished our flags and submitted them.
The flag that i made was the flag of france and it was difficult for me at first but i figured it out and made another flag which was the flag of denmark. The following images are the flags that I made in pyret
