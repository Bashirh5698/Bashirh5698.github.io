We started off this week in computer science by learning about overlaying images in pyret and we made simple shapes, it was hard at first for me to understand the ovelay command but I pulled through and figured it out. On Wednesday we finished our flags and submitted them.
The flag that i made was the flag of france and it was difficult for me at first but i figured it out and made another flag which was the flag of denmark. The following images are the flags that I made in pyret  
![franceflag](/images/franceflag.png)   ![Denmarkflag](/images/DenmarkFlag.png)
I used the place image command that I had learned to use earlier in the week the command that I had used to overlay the images that I had defined was  '''FranceFlag = place-image(wr, 300 - 150, 200 - 100, br-rr)''' for the france flag and '''DenmarkFlag = place-image(wr3, 300 - 200, 200 - 100, w2-rr)''' for the denmark flag 
making the flags was difficult at first but I eventually figured out how to do it. I hope I can improve my skill this year and be better at programming
