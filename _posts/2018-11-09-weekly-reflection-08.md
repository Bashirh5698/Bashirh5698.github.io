This week we started off by learning about data types and we played around with a function that defined different types of cakes we then started to define contracts with functions. we were supposed to make a function that defined the area of a square. I was confused about what area and perimeter were and even though i guessed based on my knoledge of computer science i still got the problem wrong when it was explained to me in class i understood the code and i feel like if i was given a similar problem in the future that I could complete it even thouh at first it was difficult for me
